# Fin Tech Project 1

---

## A price performance analysis for various crypto alt coins.
---
**Data** - Pulled from Coinbase Pro's API using the CBPRO library https://pypi.org/project/cbpro/ 

---

**Motivation** 
1. Shared interest in Crypto assets and their performance over time.
2. We sought to understand how closely alternative crypto assets (Alt Coins) performed compared to Bitcoin.
3. We also wanted to understand which alt coins performed as well, better or worse than Bitcoin historically.
4. Finally, we wanted to analyze a crypto portfolio to a comparable portfolio made up of the S&P500 stocks. 
---                 
**Questions we wanted to answer:**
1. Where can we find reliable historical data on crypto assets dating back at least two years?
2. Which alt coins performed best on a daily and cumulative basis?
3. Which alt coin prices are most closely correlated to Bitcoin price?
4. Which portfolio performed the best over the past 2 years? (slightly less due to data cleaning)
